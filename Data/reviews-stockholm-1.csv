It is located in the nicest, most trendy area of Stockholm, close to restaurants and shops, but really nice and quiet next to a park. The appartement is clean and has all you need. I would recommend it without any doubt! "

Lovisa's place was cute, clean, and located in a great area of Södermalm - still close to restaurants but in a quiet area next to a park.  Great place to rent - Enjoy!"
20083,301747,2011-06-07,41538,Barbara,"We just loved Lovisas flat!  The perfect place for one or two personnes: freshly renovated, perfectly clean, very quiet and modern. The appartment is located in a very lively and popular area of Stockholm with lots of cafes and stores and just a short distance from the old town. 
Lovisa is a very friendly and helpful host. Using her bikes was a great thing  to explore Stockholm. Thanks for that, Lovisa! We highly recommend her place for your stay in Stockholm. "

The flat itself is beautiful, with lots of light, wooden floors and a fantastic kitchen, and Lovisa is a very helpful and organised host. I would definitely stay there again, and can thoroughly recommend it. "
20083,744050,2011-11-26,1107665,David,"Lovisa and her apartment are fantastic! She is a wonderful host always happy to provide helpful tips on the apartment and the city. Easy to get to, close enough to the city to walk, and nightlife is even closer. I would recommend to all. I wish I could take the shower home!! Would love to stay again."

It is only a 5 minute walk to the Skanstull metro station and even closer to a multitude of bars restaurants and supermarkets.  
Lovisa is a wonderful host. She provided me with a great guide to local sights and restaurants. 
It would be a pleasure to stay at her place again.

Not only are you in what many people feel is the best part of Stockholm (Södermalm) but her flat is situated in an area with lots of green space.  So, the views from your windows, and the overall vibe, make it feel very tranquil.  The apartment itself is so well decorated and I found that I looked forward to spending time there at the end of each day.  The shower is amazing.  The kitchen table is a perfect place to eat and work.  The kitchen is fully equipped.  The bathroom can be a bit musty when it rains a lot but I don't think this detracts much from what is one of my favourite flats I've stayed yet with AirBnB.  Lastly, Lovisa is the ideal host.  It was very clear that she put much effort into getting the flat ready, making it spotless, and other little thoughtful details.  I look forward to staying in Lovisa's flat again as soon as I return to Stockholm!"
20083,2083556,2012-08-24,1528283,Jen,"Lovisa's apartment was perfect! It was our first trip to Stockholm and the Sodermalm location was totally ideal. Her apartment is on a quiet street and overlooks a lovely park but is also within a quick walk to the hippest bars, restaurants and boutique shopping. When my boyfriend and I were heading to downtown Stockholm, we would use the city rental bikes and there is a stand very close to Lovisa's apartment. It's about a 20 minute cycle to the central train station and Stockholm bike lanes are well done. The actual apartment was very clean, great design and absolutely ideal for a couple. Lovisa was a pleasure to communicate with and very helpful. It was a wonderful experience and I would most definitely book her cool place again. Thank you Lovisa! "

Södermalm is a very charming part of the city and the flat is located in an idyllic and quiet block. The flat itself was perfect for our stay. Cute, stylish and incredible well taken care of.

Lovisa was a great host! Very friendly and seemed to go our her way to make sure we had a good stay. My first impression of the flat was how clean it was and Lovisa had clearly cleaned every corner to make sure it was spotless.

I can highly recommend the flat to anyone wishing to rent a flat in Stockholm. "
